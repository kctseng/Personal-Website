    <h2><b>Create a Personal Website</b></h2>
    <p class="date">November 4th, 2014</p>
    <p>Today, I started to put up my personal website. I am relatively new to web developing and still learning a lot of html and css. It was fun so far, but still a lot to improve on. I like the way it looks so far, even though it does not have a lot of cool animation yet, but I think it is a very good progress.</p>
    <p>I really like the feeling of doing something interesting on my own time. My college years were pretty busy and is still busy. I don't regret what I did in the past 3 year, in fact I think I made most out of it! I went back to Taiwan during summer and I started to realize and learn that school is not the only thing I can be focusing on. That's why I started to put more time on doing things that matter to me. No matter how I did in school, the world will still be functioning and beautiful.</p>
    <p>But anyways, I think I started to find out what I really like through the codes I wrote these days in my spare time: I like to create what I want to create and learn how to create it! And I hope same goes to everyone, Find what you like and do what matters to you everyday! There are definitely responsibilities that we need to finish everyday, but put some little time to do what you like and your view of the world will be different!</p>

        <p>Yesterday, the Google recruiter said the phrase "Ture Computer Scientist". What exactly is it? I have a hard time to understand it.</p>
