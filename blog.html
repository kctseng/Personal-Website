    <h2><b>Recently</b></h2>
    <p class="date">November 22nd, 2014</p>
    <p>It's been pretty busy in the past few weeks. I was working on school projects such as the real time web and real time map. There were also few phone interviews going on almost everyweek. The experience were very fulfilling and I've been learning a lot in the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>The technical phone interviews were pretty nice. There were two types of questions: one is interview about coding functions, algorithms and data structure, which is what everyone think of for computer science type interview. Another one I got through is an interview with software design. I didn't went through this type before so I can say that I did not do well. We were discussing how class diagrams should be structured. I learned UML when I was a freshman and did not go over it in any later college courses. This phone interview definitely gave me some insight of how different types of interview can be and what I can prepare or learn more for the future. Overall it was a very valuable experience.</p>
    <p>Another thing I've worked on is to check out GitHub. I had an account since long time ago but I am not a big GitHub user. I was pretty outdated with how GitHub works. It used to be a very complicated command line process to put stuffs on last time I check but I found out they actually have a GUI software now. This is a lot more user friendly to me, and I will definitely start using it more! I've put this website up few days ago on my GitHub but it's still very empty at the moment, so I will try to load in things to GitHub as well.</p>

    <h3><b>More to the site:</b></h3>
    <p>Recently I was thinking if I want to have a new section on this personal site to document what I learned about computer science everyday. It can be a section just simply list out all the facts I learn. I definitely learned many CS facts that I didn't know before during these few weeks. And I think it's nice to put them down before I forget them. Maybe this will be something to add in soon. Other thing I want to do to the site is to dig into more on jQuery to discover more cool functions so the site will be more interactive. Last thing I need to do is to load in the project section. Hopefully these can be done soon!</p>

    <h2><b>Create a Personal Website</b></h2>
    <p class="date">November 4th, 2014</p>
    <p>Today, I started to put up my personal website. I am relatively new to web developing and still learning a lot of html and css. It was fun so far, but still a lot to improve on. I like the way it looks so far, even though it does not have a lot of cool animation yet, but I think it is a very good progress.</p>
    <p>I really like the feeling of doing something interesting on my own time. My college years were pretty busy and is still busy. I don't regret what I did in the past 3 year, in fact I think I made most out of it! I went back to Taiwan during summer and I started to realize and learn that school is not the only thing I can be focusing on. That's why I started to put more time on doing things that matter to me. No matter how I did in school, the world will still be functioning and beautiful.</p>
    <p>But anyways, I think I started to find out what I really like through the codes I wrote these days in my spare time: I like to create what I want to create and learn how to create it! And I hope same goes to everyone, Find what you like and do what matters to you everyday! There are definitely responsibilities that we need to finish everyday, but put some little time to do what you like and your view of the world will be different!</p>

        <p>Yesterday, the Google recruiter said the phrase "Ture Computer Scientist". What exactly is it? I have a hard time to understand it.</p>
