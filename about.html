        <p class="col-sm-5" id="About">Hello, my name is Kacey. I am currently a senior attending University of California, Irvine. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Business Information management.

        <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:50px; margin-right:50px;">
            After graduated from Edison High School, New Jersey in 2011. I moved to California by myself to attend University of California, Irvine. <br/><br/>
            As a Freshman, I was exploring campus clubs, meeting people, and enjoy all the activities that college offers me. I joined Anteaters Tzu Ching, which is a community service club that I shared value with. <br/><br/>
            Sophomore year, I joined UCI Anteaters Band and performed in almost all the basketball games. Also went to Honda Center for Big West Tournament with the team. It was very time consuming, but very satisfying and enjoyable. During the same year, I took the role as Historian for Anteaters Tzu Ching club to document all the club events. <br/><br/>
            Junior year is the most fulfilling year so far. I became Treasurer of Anteaters Tzu Ching club. I volunteered over 100 hours throughout the year for the club which was the most out of the whole club. The same year, our club was in charge of hosting a regional social event for other chapters. I was honored to come up with the idea of a theme song, wrote the lyrics, and planned out the song for the event. I was also in charge of various parts of planning. Here is the theme song that I was in charge of: <br/></p>

           <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-bottom:50px; margin-right:50px;"> I also competed in 2 AppJams and 1 hackathon. My team created a medical iOS app that treats motion sickness as well as a website to help Autism children to learn how to handle money. My Hackathon team won the best startup idea in HackUCI. I was the lab tutor for the JAVA courses that UCI offered. Soon after, I was hired as an intern at Western Digital. Junior year was busy but a BIG year for me! I was happy that I got all the chances and time to make it happen. <br/><br/>
               This year is my last year of college, I am the co-president of my club. I took the role as a mentor for lower classmen in my major. I am looking forward to this year and see what more can I accomplish!
